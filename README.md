# Quizzical

A small trivia quiz app, made in React, using the React's ContextAPI. This app was made as the last project for the [Learn React for free](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) course on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/). Have always wanted to learn web development, I decided to pick this course up to try and learn React. This course taught me the basics of React, and I learned how to use the `useState` and `useEffect` hook of React. Later, I used `useContext` to implement the state manager of this small app.

This app is made possible using the questions fetched from [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/). The data is then presented on the page, then users can play the quiz, and check their results. 

**TODO:** Make the app responsive for different device size.
